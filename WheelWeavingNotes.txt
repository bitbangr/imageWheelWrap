Wheel Weave Notes

Thurs Aug 1

Generated list of thread weave points using
Processing - imageWrapAlgorithm
Generated a byte dat file with bytes.  (using 0-200 so byte is most efficient storage mechanism)
Used Hex Fiend to open dat file and copy into Text Wrangler
Used copy paste for " " to ",0x" to conver to text HEX String ie "7E BF 3D" becomes "0x7E,0xBF,0x3D"
Copied this string to Arduino JeanneNurseGradProgMemArray sketch and used this as 
conts byte thread_Points[] PROGMEM array.  IE Stored in 32K Flash Memory for Arduino
 Code just pumps first and last 100 of this array to serial port for verification.
 
 Next steps
 
 1) Map each point visually on the LED Wheel for threading
 2) Hook up an button to advance thread (or reverse thread)
 2a) Hook up a 2 line display to show progress meter 
 4) Do a cool intro LED blinky display before beginning
 5) Do a cool finihed LED blinky display 
 3) Setup stop motion on iphone and capture -
 		30 second intro real time with LED Blinky Intro
 		1 minute speed up  (6 hours) 30 Frames in 6 hours 5 frame per hr??? Or 1 Frame every 12 minutes??? 
 		30 second end real time wht LED Blinky End
 		30 second view of finish project
 	Add music and show it
